# Advanced Econometrics

How does increasing the Minimum Wage affect youth unemployment? Is rent control an effective policy? 
Did some drug really improve patients' health?

All of these causal questions require quantitative techniques to measure treatment effects.

In this repository several statistical properties are derived for Advanced Data Analytics, specifically for Causal Inference.
Additionally, selected solutions to Fumio Hayashi's *Econometrics* are provided.
